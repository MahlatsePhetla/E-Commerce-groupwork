Data Flow Plan

The data flow plan for this project outlines how information moves and interacts
within the e-commerce database. It specifies the input processes for adding
products, attributes, and variations, as well as how users browse and filter data. The
plan also describes relationships between tables, ensuring products, categories,
attributes, and variations are connected logically and then also details the processes
for output.

1. Data Input
   
Administrative Input:
 Products: Admins input essential details such as product names, base prices,
brands, and categories.
 Attributes: Admins define categories for attributes (e.g., physical or technical)
and specify attribute types (e.g., text, number, boolean).
 Variations: Admins associate product variations (e.g., sizes, colours) with
corresponding products.

User Interaction:

 Browsing: Users view a catalogue combining products with their respective
attributes and variations.
 Filtering and Searching: Users apply filters for attributes such as size, colour,
or category to narrow their search results.

2. Data Processes
   
Product and Variations Relationship
Each product is linked to one or more variations through a VariationID.
Variations are composed of attributes like size and colour, sourced from distinct
tables to ensure modular design.
Attributes and Categories

Attributes for products are grouped into logical categories, such as technical
specifications or material descriptions.
Each product variation is enriched with its associated attributes, allowing precise
filtering and searches.

Category Management

Products are categorized hierarchically or by functional groupings via a CategoryID.
This ensures products are efficiently organized for both administrative management
and user browsing.
Data Normalization and Consistency
Common elements, such as brands, sizes, or attributes, are stored in separate
tables to reduce redundancy.
Referential integrity is enforced using foreign keys and constraints, ensuring data
consistency and reliability.

3. Data Output
   
Front-end Views:
Users access dynamic pages displaying product details, attributes, and variations.
Filtered search results are generated by querying relationships between tables,
allowing users to refine their options based on preferences.
Data Flow during Purchase:
When a user selects a product variation for purchase, the database queries the
relevant table to check details such as availability and price.
Upon transaction completion, stock quantities are updated to reflect inventory
changes accurately.
